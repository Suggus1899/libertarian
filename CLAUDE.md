# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Source of truth

This project's stack, commands, architecture, and conventions live in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — read it before making changes. It is kept up to date manually and is imported below so it's always in context.

@AGENTS.md

## Claude Code specific notes

- `AGENTS.md` and this `CLAUDE.md` file are intentionally **never committed** to git going forward, even though `AGENTS.md` is already tracked from an earlier commit. Keep both updated locally, but don't `git add`/commit further changes to them unless the user explicitly asks.
- Commit messages for this repo are written in **Spanish** (`fix: evitar crash en...`), which is an exception to the English-commit convention used in the rest of this user's projects.
- After every `git commit` the user wants an immediate `git push` — don't wait to be asked.
- No test framework is configured (`package.json` has no `test` script) — don't add one unless asked. Minimum verification before considering a change done: `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build`.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **libertarian** (905 symbols, 1590 relationships, 73 execution flows).

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze --index-only` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? Bootstrap with `npx`, `bunx`, or `pnpm dlx` — e.g. `bunx gitnexus@latest analyze` (npm 11 npx crash; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing.** Use `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs impact "symbolName" --direction upstream --repo .` (CLI fallback); report callers, processes, and risk. Never substitute grep for graph analysis.
- **MUST analyze graph changes before committing.** Use `detect_changes({scope: "all"})` (MCP) or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope all --repo .` (CLI fallback). `partial: true` or `truncated: true` is not a clean check — a zero means unseen, not unaffected; re-run it. For regression review: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "master"})` or `node .gitnexus/run.cjs detect-changes --scope compare --base-ref "master" --repo .`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- **MUST treat `risk: UNKNOWN` as unresolved, not as low.** An empty caller set is not evidence the symbol is unused — it can also mean the callers are not resolvable by the index (plain-object property access, dynamic dispatch, cross-language calls). `impact` pairs `UNKNOWN` with a `riskNote` saying so. Confirm with a text search before treating the symbol as safe to change or delete; do not proceed on the strength of a zero.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method before MCP/CLI impact analysis.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis, and never read `UNKNOWN` as an all-clear — it means the walk could not answer, which is the one verdict that requires confirming by other means.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit before MCP/CLI graph change analysis.
